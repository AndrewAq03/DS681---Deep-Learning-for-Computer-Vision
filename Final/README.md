## PPO and GRPO Agents in Breakout Environment

In this assignment you will extend an existing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) implementation for Atari Breakout in order to develop and evaluate a variant known as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). GRPO was recently proposed as a simplified policy-gradient method for large-scale language-model training, but its underlying mechanism is broadly applicable. Your task is to adapt it to a classical control environment, implement it, and conduct controlled experiments comparing PPO and GRPO.

## Github rip for agent: https://github.com/pantelis/breakout-ppo-agent

Hello, for this task I ran the code in google colab as my hardware isnt great. The issue I ran into is that I ran out of GPU computing units so I had to use the CPU and cut the runs short.
