This task required us to analyze the commentary and query some questions about the game. These are all the documents, code and results. I used two LLMs to compare the results of each. 

## Transcription 
- I used FFmpeg to convert the video(.mp4) to just audio(.mp3)
- Used Whisper to transcribe the audio
- Saved the transcribe file to plain text and SRT for timestamps

## Queries
I used the same prompts or queries for each LLM. I used Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5
- Summarize the key moments
- Analyze the player that scored the most in this game
- Can you compare Lebron James vs Stephen Curry performance?
- Each Folder has the results for each respective LLM
