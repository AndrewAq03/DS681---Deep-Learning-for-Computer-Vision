1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
winning streak

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,000
And the warriors ended with a six game winning streak

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,640
Watch out james again with that right ankle. He played last couple of games did tweak it on sunday

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,000
But he played very well in those final two games

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,960
And here's one of the fun matchups in this series anthony davis has to take a tough shot. Well defended by draymond green

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,960
And

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,040
Obviously both teams would love to get the win tonight and give it a little extra time to heal and prepare for their opponent

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,840
As andrew wingans gets inside and gets the bucket

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,200
To me, he's the key they need

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,960
25 from him tonight to be able to score enough

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,960
to win

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,200
Schruder nice play and drumming

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,160
Well a big flush down the other end and that's a welcome sight for laker fans is not anthony davis and labron james

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,480
Making every play but you get shrewder

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,200
Making plays for drumming they can be dangerous

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,080
Ken bainsmar for three that's good

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,760
You know steve kurt talking before the game knows it's a taunting task

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,080
Against a laker team when healthy they're as good as anybody in the league, but he also knows just one game

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,960
That's all you have to win. This is not a playoff series

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
It's a one game and move on

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,040
Schruder's jumper ball tipped and taken by draymond green

22
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,520
On the season warriors 39 and 33, but they finished

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,680
Winning 15 of their final 20 games in the regular season just great basketball as wingans

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,200
Knocks down another and he's playing with a lot more confidence. Look at that

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,240
He didn't wait for steph curry to make a play waved everybody out of the way

26
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,880
And took advantage of his matchup

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,240
James to davis davis goes right at draymond green again. Well defended davis thought he was hit

28
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,160
Lakers have not been dominant at home this season clearly a lot of that had to do with missing the two players

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:12,480
As curry pulls back, but despite all the misses as draymond green kicks it out to basemore and basemore from the elbow jumper way off

30
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,560
Looney has to throw it up then hit the ram and it goes in kavon looney

31
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,120
Very aware of the shot clock about to expire

32
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,400
But jeff you talked about

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:32,660
Without anthony davis and lebron james you were impressed as shrewder misses impressed the way the lakers kept being competitive absolutely defensively

34
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,140
They remained rock solid. They just had some troubles offensively

35
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:44,100
But what they've done defensively all year to be the best team in the league at that end is special

36
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:52,900
Curry throws the pass stolen by anthony davis number one rated defensive team davis for three

37
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,740
Rebound kept alive by drummond, but he's going to be called for a loose ball foul

38
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,260
Andre drummond signed at the end of march after a buyout

39
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,260
With the cavaliers

40
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,900
This is his 22nd game started all 21 games average just under 12 points little over 10 rebounds

41
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:19,140
But frank vocals is still a work in progress trying to get him comfortable and familiar with playing with his new teammates

42
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,220
Curry to looney

43
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,980
Curry using a dream on green screen nice feet inside looney shot blocked

44
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,580
Andre jonman with the rejection looney was ready to throw it down

45
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,420
James to davis

46
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,700
James with the tip and with the left hand and frank vocals irate. He thought david davis got fouled again

47
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,260
I thought it was a good block

48
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,940
Curry flips it up shot too strong looney back out to basemore wide open three

49
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,740
And vulgar wants a timeout hot start

50
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,020
Such so many different matchups to look at have fun. Let's let's start with steph curry jeff

51
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,260
How do the lakers try and guard him? What do you think their their game plan will be?

52
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,600
Well, the thing I think for a great defensive team like the lakers that they have to avoid is overreacting

53
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,140
To curry and leaving others open. That's what's happened to start this game

54
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,580
Meanwhile mark a big question for frank vogel and the lakers they've got the size advantage

55
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:25,380
They've got the traditional centers golden state likes to play small ball. How do you handle that if you're frank?

56
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,780
Well to me, I like to see him post up. Lebron james gets a smaller

57
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:37,060
Wiggins our last possession basemore defending him take advantage of that size of strength creating offense for himself as an aggressive

58
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,580
or for his teammates wiggins is a great defensive team and

59
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,620
Golden state the fifth rated defense in the nba this year

60
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,420
Oh and wiggins with the block of james has to fire it up and it's the side of the backboard

61
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
Great defensive play from andrew wiggins

62
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,660
This is a great defensive play coach. But in my opinion lebron lets him off the hook. He fades away

63
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:03,220
There's no help coming. That's one-on-one beat him on your terms go towards the basket as opposed to fading away from him

64
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,500
Absolutely, and the way he's going to play that's going to be a great defensive play

65
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,920
On your terms go towards the basket as opposed to fading away from absolutely

66
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:19,780
Wiggins had a strong finish to the season especially after the all-star break not only the defense but averaging over 20 per game

67
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,580
ball deflected by caldwell pulp

68
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,260
Wiggins guarded by james down the other end knocks down the three

69
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,580
Pretty good couple of sequences for andrew wiggins to start his play-in game. He's had a tremendous year

70
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,500
I mean

71
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,700
When he's the third most important player like he was in minnesota the year they went to the playoffs when he was there

72
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,180
It's a perfect role for him. I mean he's played exceptional basketball this year

73
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,900
particularly the second half of the year

74
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:53,300
Drummond puts it on the floor double team back out to davis shot clock down a three james a three-pointer way off

75
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,100
And ramon bringing the rebound the lakers have missed nine of their first 11 from the field

76
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,780
Baysmore running gets it to loonie and loonie and a held ball with anthony davis

77
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:09,300
I'm, just thinking about it think about your third best player with the ability to average 20 to 25 points

78
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,580
You put clay thompson with this unit watch out next year

79
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,060
Absolutely, and I give steve kerr a lot of credit. He's narrowed his rotation. They play eight guys now

80
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,000
There's more comfort level. They're an older team. They're experienced

81
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:32,120
You don't go far in the nba playoffs playing all young guys you saw clay thompson there once that injury

82
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,240
It changed a lot of plans for the golden state warriors

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,320
James now guarded by baysmore wiegand's helps out shrewder good ball movement here called well pope. Good luck knocks down the three

84
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,280
And that's what they want out of that double team I would rather stunt at anthony davis

85
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,160
Stay at home with called well pope and make anthony davis shoot and make threes

86
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:03,800
You see shrewder initially on steph curry. There'll be a number of players james with the deflection, but wiggins able to get it back

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,840
shock lock down to four

88
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,840
wiggins pull off three

89
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:15,880
And drummond rips down the rebound drummond one of the premier elite rebounders in the game throughout his career

90
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,520
James

91
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,660
Called well pulp off balance

92
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,780
James goes down a lane the runner and draws the foul on baysmore

93
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,480
Well, they get the switch and then they double and they full rotate

94
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,000
That's a long closeout by wiggins

95
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,960
again, I would have rather stunted off of

96
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,840
Caldwell pope and made anthony davis

97
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,240
Shoot the long ball

98
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,960
And mike did we have starting lineups earlier? Yes

99
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:00,600
I wish they were sponsored by taco bell and I could have said sponsored by taco fall

100
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm surprised you waited so long to take your first shot man. You didn't come up for breath. So I

101
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,560
Was i've been sitting on that

102
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,500
It's the free throw but

103
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,120
Congratulations to you

104
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:21,400
On truly a hall of fame career. It was an honor to be at your induction. Absolutely. Well deserved in an incredible speech

105
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,800
You made us proud partner

106
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Thank you gentlemen, but this is a fact

107
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,440
I couldn't have done it without you man. We don't need to hear that. That's fake hustle. That's like saying

108
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,240
Curry couldn't have done it without

109
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
Jordan bell. Come on

110
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,760
Why can't you just say thank you though as well? Thank you. No, no, you don't mean that don't say thank you

111
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
He's not sincere man. It's about him

112
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
Well, here's lead by six

113
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,360
True to guarding curry again curry launches a three-pointer that one off the bark for the rebound want to scott o anderson

114
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,860
Draymond green tries a three that misses drumming hauls in another rebound

115
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,860
So

116
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,700
Michael molder also in the game for golden state. Here's basemore

117
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,860
Mulder runs to the corner, but basemore banks it won't go to scott o anderson misses the tip here comes james

118
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,200
Schruder corner three james the offensive rebound

119
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
So

120
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,920
Quick move inside draws the contact shot won't go but a foul and he will go right back to the free throw line

121
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,760
But I don't want to sound like a broken record

122
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,200
But that's the type of plays he's got to make especially the way that they're defending him and I understand coming off

123
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
Injury, he's trying to feel his way through the game

124
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,600
But as we move closer and closer towards getting involved into this game, I expect to see labron a little bit more aggressive

125
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,580
Now you see those two games the last two of the regular season did tweak again the ankle on sunday, but nothing serious

126
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,220
So

127
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:18,180
James missing a career high 27 games only played 45 games at those 20 consecutive out with the ankle injury

128
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:24,660
Now playing in the playing game where he famously said wherever came up with this should be fired

129
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,060
I think the whole thing has been pretty exciting curry on the drive

130
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,140
Flips it up back shot is good step curry with his first field goal coach

131
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,960
Just look at the size difference between these two teams on the floor right now at every position

132
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
So

133
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,280
James finds caldwell pope another corner three another one knocking it down called well pope

134
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,440
Two for two from three-point range

135
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Welcome back to warriors lakers now

136
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,880
If you see labron james go to the bench a little more often than usual in this first half

137
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:14,840
Coach frank vocal told me that's because the more minutes labron plays the more his ankle tends to stiffen up

138
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:21,400
So they are going to try if they don't fall too far behind here to backload his minutes and keep him under 30 total

139
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:27,880
Now you just saw the playback in march where he got initially hurt. This is where he tweaked it again just three days ago

140
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,240
LeBron told us he hadn't stopped thinking about the way this injury derailed his season

141
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,680
He had to rehab for more than six weeks and said quote I hated every moment of it

142
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,680
But mike he said he's ready to move forward and he doesn't anticipate his movement being limited in any real way tonight

143
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,840
Thank you. Rachel. You forget how well he was playing

144
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:55,800
Prior to the injury how well the lakers were playing prior to the injury to james and davis. They were 21 and 6

145
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,120
Caruso wide open nobody near him and he cans the three

146
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,000
and they did

147
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,160
On that one stay at home on caldwell pope, but caruso shot the ball very well from three this year

148
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,360
draymond green gets inside and draws the foul

149
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,080
on andre drummond

150
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
And green's shaking up

151
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,980
Well good stunt by basemore

152
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,060
But caruso again really improved as a three-point shooter

153
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So green will go to the line

154
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:45,000
Green has had one outstanding season, especially defensively when he hits the first our upcoming national tv schedule tnt tomorrow

155
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
indiana and washington

156
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,720
And that game

157
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,160
After indiana with the victory washington losing to boston then espn friday. Memphis will play the loser of this game

158
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,960
It's a nine eastern start and will be either in san francisco or here at the staples center

159
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,840
I'll tell you indiana played a great

160
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,000
Offensive game down three of their main guys. So bonus

161
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,560
He's a great

162
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,580
Great offensive player. Absolutely

163
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:23,400
They started off great and did not let their foot off the gas pedal davis after kuzma kyle kuzma montrezl harrell in the game

164
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,680
Raymond green on davis one-on-one excellent defense again stolen by basemore

165
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,680
So

166
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,760
Basemore goes right at davis throws up a wild shot and draws the foul anthony davis picking up his first

167
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,960
That is outstanding defense by draymond green one-on-one against anthony davis for the second time

168
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,320
You just you just battle them and you stay in front and don't give them anything easy active hands

169
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,960
Secure your position be disciplined and give your team a chance exactly what he did

170
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Basemore in the starting lineup

171
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:07,400
As colin state has some injuries kelly ubre still out with the left wrist. He's going to be reevaluated next week

172
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:13,720
James wiseman, of course their center out for the season with right knee surgery. Damian lee also out and of course that man

173
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,120
Missing his second consecutive year

174
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,320
Can't wait to see him back in uniform running up and down the floor

175
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,840
And they need him and you look at this game. For example, the war is not going to win if step curry

176
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,600
Doesn't get going at some point the lakers are forcing him to get rid of the basketball where he sees bodies in front of him

177
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,200
The sconnow anderson misses the three called paul pulp the rebound

178
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,520
They're doing a good job of keeping two people he comes off a pick and roll

179
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,840
They don't leave them until he gets rid of the basketball

180
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,040
Step curry's taking just three shots so far

181
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,140
Mulder some early minutes guarding caruso

182
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,580
So

183
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:54,620
Caldwell pope nice screen set by davis step back jumper won't go

184
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,760
Green has been absolutely great defensively

185
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,820
Curry against kuzma. There's a double team second turnover by curry

186
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:15,020
Kuzma to caruso drives inside lefty layup is good. It goes crashing right focal again saying where was the whistle lot of contact there

187
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,220
And caruso off the bench with five points

188
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,220
The active hands come up with the steal and good delivery by kuzma

189
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,220
Russo with the finish that's clearly contact. You should be going to the line

190
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,900
Curry double again

191
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,340
Ramon green fakes davis right there

192
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,460
Five on the 24 curry fakes the three gets away from davis off one foot too strong

193
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:47,260
And here comes kuzma lakers have made it difficult early for steph curry

194
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,540
Kuzma a three-pointer

195
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,580
And a loose ball foul is going to go against curry

196
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,100
And coach, you know people say well, how can you get them going?

197
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,620
Well, you can get them going by getting stops defensively and pushing the basketball is tougher to trap pick and rolls

198
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,900
When you're pushing it in transition and a technical foul, I believe on draymond green

199
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,540
Green gosh, tibbinson. I don't want to hear it

200
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,380
Green now trying to talk

201
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,380
Whatever happened to the parent that says I don't want to hear it then you still talking they said I said I don't want to hear

202
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,180
That's the end of it. He just gave him an extra candy bar

203
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:33,340
That foul by the way was on molder not curry as davis hits the technical free throw and now

204
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,780
Much more

205
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,780
Pleasant conversation

206
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,340
josh, tibbinson and I have a difference of opinion of what no more means

207
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,380
Josh, tibbinson has become one of the premier officials in the nba in recent years

208
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:56,780
And you get a technical and since we don't count this as the playoffs it doesn't count against any suspension so you can

209
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,340
These are freebies

210
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Trueter in there up top to caruso

211
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,660
And throws it back in the corner

212
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:12,300
And throws it out of bounds he's talking about the playing stats do not count toward the regular season and do not count toward the playoffs

213
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,180
They kind of fade away I suppose but it's also, you know, it's the same for the broadcast. So whatever you say

214
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:24,380
It's okay. You can say whatever you want. It's not it's not recorded. He does that in any way mike. I'm just saying they should count

215
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,580
I saw jason tatum's 50 as molder dumps it counts

216
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,880
Put them in the postseason. This is the postseason

217
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,280
I'm in agreement with you. I think they're uh, they're trying to figure out what's the best way

218
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,200
I just figured it out for them. I'm just staying with their thinking curry on the rebound. This is miss

219
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,160
Curry way downtown in and out and davis the rebound

220
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,480
Lakers shooting just 32 from the field, but they're only down by three

221
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
Shrewder misses the three

222
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:06,160
Montrezl harrell spins flips it up shot won't go tipped by kuzma and another offensive rebound which he's been doing all season

223
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Shrewder misses the three

224
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,640
And curry the rebound curry averaged a career high five and a half rebounds per game this year

225
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,600
Gets inside draws the foul count it and one

226
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:26,400
And to me that's the most underrated two things about his game the rebounding aspect and the finishing aspect

227
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,500
Is that he's got a great

228
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
That's just beautiful

229
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:40,080
Touch around the rim this year. He became the oldest scoring champion in the nba in 23 years

230
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,480
When michael jordan was 35 he finished the season with 46 points on sunday against memphis

231
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,160
He was just absolutely sensational. Of course a lot of the talk this week. Lebron james saying the other day

232
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:58,560
MVP he had the best season all year. Well, he's had an incredible season and it's it's a joy to cover him and watch him

233
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:05,280
As davis knocks down the little floater. He was 0 for 6. Sam fitty davis before that shot and it's back to four

234
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,480
But I like what he did instead of posting screen on the ball

235
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,040
And get some space from green

236
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:18,320
Want to scott o anderson knocks down a three turns and says something to the fans and runs down the floor

237
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,880
He has one been a one of the great stories this year in the nba

238
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,160
The east oakland native now playing for his team that he grew up rooting for

239
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,560
Schruder shot block to scott o anderson saves it but right to harold blocked by green but a foul

240
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,080
Again two free throws coming up for la

241
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
See the great ball movement and

242
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,360
The young fella gets it done oakland's finest

243
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,280
Proud to be a warrior. Well this happy ending for him. He just signed a multi-year contract to play for the team again

244
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,220
Growing up rooted for his undrafted out of marquette back in 2015 took him five years to get to the nba

245
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,160
mexico argentina venezuela the g league

246
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,800
And he has become so much more than an energy player. Bob myers absolutely loves him

247
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:21,060
He's got terrific skill. He's extremely smart. Draymond green says he changes the game with his intensity

248
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,600
And steve kerr says I trust him

249
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,440
It's been a great story and he's the one guy that can do draymond green type things on the floor

250
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,640
Initiating offense setting screens extra pass

251
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
What a fine by the warriors

252
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,040
Steve Kerr actually calls him a mini draymond green

253
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,240
You think I just freestyled that mike well, I wanted to give a little credit come on loonie the rebound

254
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
six point warriors lead

255
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,680
It was about a five-second difference between the shot clock and game clock

256
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
Very just two for six to start

257
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,160
Mulder wiggins

258
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,480
Rebound shrewder final seconds. No fouls to give here shooter ahead to davies

259
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,640
Davis three pointers up shot short

260
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,440
Welcome back to the state farm nba play-in tournament. I'm rachel nichols here with coach steve

261
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,360
Her great start you guys got out to steve. What was working for you?

262
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,880
Well, I thought our defense was really good rachel and it's been good, you know the last few weeks and that's uh,

263
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,080
That's what we have to play off of so our guys did a good job

264
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,920
What's your approach to the size disadvantage that your team has here tonight?

265
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,880
Well, we just got to make sure everybody's engaged all the time and you know keeping everyone off the glass they're they're obviously

266
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,200
Much bigger and stronger than we are but if we're active and we're boxing out with all five guys we can hold our own

267
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,560
Thanks so much steve. All right back to you. Mike. Thank you rachel fifth turnover for golden state

268
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,400
James five points in that first quarter tail important tucker out there with james shrewder kuzma

269
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,400
And harold

270
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,480
Horton tucker straight on three. That's good. This young man's having

271
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,500
An excellent season in terms of taking some steps, but the three-pointer

272
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,720
Has been at times a struggle for him nice shot there and it's a three-point game

273
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Jordan pulled the floater

274
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:26,160
Looney's follow misses harold the rebound no curry. No green with james on the floor

275
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
This is going to be a challenge

276
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:35,600
James drives you can't get it and kavon looney grabs another rebound seven rebounds already for kavon looney. They'll need him

277
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,800
With the size advantage of the lakers

278
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,920
Mulder catch and shoot that's good three-pointer from mulder. He can shoot the second-year guard from kentucky

279
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,480
Well, you look at this unit on the floor for the warriors right now

280
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,440
No curry or green, but they have the ability to get the ball in the middle of the field

281
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,040
Warriors right now no curry or green

282
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,760
But they have the ability to compete at a high level spread the floor and they have shooting all around

283
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,480
Shruder drives shrewder misses looney grabs another defensive rebound

284
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,820
And interestingly they have tiskano anderson on shrewder

285
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:23,360
Pool has it eight to shoot tiskano anderson not that time fight for the rebound. Come on looney

286
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,000
Nine rebounds now already another three

287
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
Mulder can't get it to go

288
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,720
Six point golden state lead with two minutes into the second

289
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:46,480
They played each other three times warriors won the first game lakers two blowouts after that, but both teams obviously so radically different now

290
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,480
So

291
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
Kuzma

292
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,000
And it hit one of the wires atop the backboard so it's golden state ball

293
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,200
Stop curry talking about the the warriors. She said back in

294
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:13,200
In february march. It was a little bleak, but he's so proud of the way this team just kept fighting

295
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,760
And he says now we've given ourselves a chance

296
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,960
To make this season matter curry and green the leadership they showed

297
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
And the warriors turned it around

298
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
The scano anderson feet inside

299
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:36,480
Looney shot in and out. LeBron james rips down the rebound. That's outstanding possession though. Great ball movement making plays for one another

300
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,120
Just wasn't able to finish. It's tiskano anderson

301
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,840
Like you mentioned before mark can really?

302
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,640
pass and make plays

303
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,160
Montrezl harrell

304
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,000
foul by looney

305
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,040
And the former six-man winner with the clippers will go to the line

306
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,800
It has not been an easy adjustment for montrezl last year played so well for the la clippers this year

307
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:04,160
He's had some some good stretches. His numbers are solid not playing as many minutes not getting as much touches

308
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,840
But it's been inconsistent at times. Well three centers makes it a challenge for the coaching staff

309
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,480
and for the three players

310
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,720
And I think the thing if i'm if i'm harrell my mentality has got to be

311
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,440
The way I got paid and made it in this league

312
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,680
I gave great energy great effort great enthusiasm from day one

313
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,200
So I was a difference maker because of the way I went about my business

314
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,240
He's got to get back to being that then he's a handful to defend

315
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,320
And I think it's interesting too. I think the challenge going forward

316
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,760
For the coaching staff is at times last year

317
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,240
They played with

318
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,160
As a free throw rebound's given up they played with anthony davis at center

319
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,960
So now that they have three other centers

320
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,960
Do you ever get back to that lineup right? It's basically four centers that

321
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,880
All feel they deserve time horton tucker goes inside flips it up and an offensive foul is called

322
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,080
Well tucker picks up the personal frank vogel obviously disagrees with the call

323
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
Morton tucker wants to see the replay

324
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,680
Not a lot there

325
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,320
To me, that's not a defensive foul

326
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,640
But it's not an offensive foul either

327
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,880
Pool to wiggins wiggins trying to slam a shot block porton tucker right there minimum of the rim and then a foul

328
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840
As wiggins goes crashing to the floor

329
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,080
I like wiggins trying to attack like that

330
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,960
So attacking the rim

331
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
Good job of going vertical

332
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
But I like like you talked about here

333
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,680
They need him to be aggressive on the offensive end

334
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Bow was on caruso

335
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,280
Caruso picks up his first

336
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:59,680
Here's pool and pool is fouled before any shot attempt caruso trying to fight over the screen picks up his second

337
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
And I agree with the lake is defensively right now

338
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,880
You have to treat jordan pool the way you treat

339
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,680
Steph curry with that first unit because he's a guy that can get hot and then the rim opens up for him

340
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,360
Pull the last six games average 20 a game

341
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,480
He had a career high 38 last week

342
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,680
You know with curry on the bench frank vocal said he's kind of taken over like the cj mccollum

343
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,560
Roll in terms of when lillard goes to the bench mccollum has to score they need pool to score

344
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Not that time as kuzma gets the rebound

345
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,440
Not that he was comparing him to cj mccollum

346
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,160
portent tucker

347
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,160
short on the through

348
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Here's pool inside the arc

349
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Six on the 24

350
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:04,400
Wiggins against caruso nice spin move and finish from andrew wiggins. He's got nine points. He has a great right to left spin

351
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,880
Harold

352
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,440
Knocked away ball picked up to scott o anderson

353
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,120
Two-on-one break goes right at lebron james and finishes

354
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
And a timeout call by frank vocal

355
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,680
They got a lot of doubt down there. We got we got a lot of belief good job guys good quarter

356
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,160
Holding our own on the boards defending without fouling all good stuff

357
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,640
He has been proud of this team talked about, you know disjointed early. Obviously the injury to clay thompson

358
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,520
He said that they've come together really well as the season went on. He kept telling the team late in the season

359
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,800
We're going to go on a run. We're going to go on a run and they finished 15 and five in those last 20 games

360
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,280
And I like how wiggins is picking up full court

361
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:58,560
On occasions james drives gets inside block by tesco anderson knocked out of bounds still laker ball

362
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,040
This is just good verticality boy this kid is tough

363
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,600
Warriors have five block shots already

364
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:17,760
James gets inside bank shot missed it ball tipped out to scott o anderson pushing it up the floor

365
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:24,720
Mulder pool to scott o anderson out there with loonie and wiggins wiggins fires a three way off

366
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:33,520
And it's laker ball and you look at this game right now with seven minutes to go on in the second quarter

367
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,760
One team is getting after it like they want it and the other team is in chill mode

368
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,520
And if you're the lakers you have to respond because the warriors are here

369
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,680
to advance to sunday

370
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:50,480
Kuzma gets that one to go prior to that shot. The lakers were shooting 24 from the field. They had missed eight shots in a row

371
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,540
That's a very strong assertive move by kuzma

372
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:07,440
Wiggins to loonie tescano anderson can't get the three montrezl harrell with the board

373
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,160
Montrezl harrell with the board

374
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:19,200
James finds montrezl harrell inside and throws it down in a crowd

375
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,360
This first field goal

376
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Timeout call by steve curve

377
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,520
The warriors are shooting 38 29 from three and steph curry has five points

378
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:42,640
Now both these teams their defense has been a big part of their success as we mentioned lakers number one defensive rating and the warriors

379
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
number five

380
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,880
Pool goes right out drumming layup is good. Top shot from jordan pool

381
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:58,480
Lakers looking to push the other way steve kurt talked about that. He wants his team to really push the tempo tonight

382
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,000
Shruder gets some room davis tries the three

383
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,720
Davis have not shot the ball well from three since his return from the camp injury

384
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:16,160
Curry finds some room gets inside draws the foul banker won't go he's mad at himself, but he'll get two free throws

385
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,400
And that's two straight pick and rolls

386
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,120
That drumming has been ineffective in defending. He's got to get down a little bit lower. He has great feet

387
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
He can do this

388
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,000
But he can't reach and get himself out of position

389
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:40,000
Curry has talked this year. It's the best he's felt physically and the best he is seeing the game this year

390
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,160
And the year off last year

391
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,880
Might have helped him get the ball

392
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,880
Last year

393
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,240
Might have helped

394
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,660
That as well only five games played with a broken hand. There's no question it re-energized

395
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,240
And you know players will talk about this guys who play in the finals year after year the grind of that lebron james

396
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,520
That's one of the unbelievable things about what he's able to do. It's almost like another season

397
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,560
And it has recharged him

398
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,560
So

399
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,560
Dennis shrewder trying to get going still looking for his first field goal throws it away green with the steel

400
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,100
That's great pick and roll defense. I mean that's superior

401
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,560
Ability to play to play the ball handler and play the role man

402
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
You

403
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:47,860
See shrewder he's got to come off the score green stunning at him and recovering that's beautiful that's outstanding

404
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,200
Steve kurt talks about it all the time. He knows what the opponent is running

405
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,360
He blows up opponents plays all the time nice feet inside, but basemore rushed it

406
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:06,480
Although davis's presence had something to do with that caldwell pulp three-pointer short right back to him up top to shrewder

407
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,560
And he's going to get a little bit more into the ball

408
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,560
And he's going to get a little bit more into the ball

409
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,600
Caldwell pulp pass inside broke it up basemore this time got a hand on it

410
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,720
Boy active hands again from the warriors pool explodes to the rim and finishes

411
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:27,280
Jordan, pull his second field goal and it's back to a 10-point warriors lead the lakers have 30 points

412
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,680
And there's under five to play in the first half

413
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:42,400
Caruso barely had it in his hand knocks down the three i'm looking at that last possession anthony davis has kent

414
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,700
Basemore on him and comes out to send a high screen roll a side screen and roll. Oh, give me the basketball

415
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,740
It's your time to be a little bit more aggressive

416
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:58,980
The sconnell anderson basemore fakes drives on caruso leans in on drum and flips it up way off

417
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,980
And

418
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:09,700
An offensive foul is going to be called on anthony davis and frank bogle hot once again

419
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,980
Well right now draymond green is putting on a master's class on how to defend

420
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:22,500
He has taken anthony davis out of the ballgame now that's that's that's just a smart play

421
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,980
He puts himself in position to take the hit

422
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:32,020
But he is in the head of anthony davis thus far and some joy going on right now and a technical foul

423
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,020
We'll hand it out double technical

424
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:41,000
John goebel came in. I believe it's on davis and tuscano anderson. The warriors are saying why is it a double technical?

425
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:49,220
If you're draymond green, you don't want to get caught in this you already have a technical foul yourself

426
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,260
So it is on davis, but the other one's on pool jordan pool

427
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,220
And the other one's on the ballgame

428
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
And the other one is on the ballgame

429
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
And the other one is on the ballgame

430
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,060
And the other one is on the ballgame

431
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:12,680
That's like the old line when the nca got really mad at kentucky. They put cleveland state on probation

432
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:19,800
Curry for three his first three-pointer of the half and from way downtown

433
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,800
LeBron james back in

434
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,780
Schruder 0 for 7. It's james guarded by tescano anderson

435
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,800
Leans in excellent defense throws it away

436
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,000
Boy, this colin state defense as you said mark, they're putting on a clinic here in the first half

437
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
five to shoot for the lakers

438
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800
So

439
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:00,220
Shot clock winding down and pool with a foul with 3.4 remaining on the shot clock

440
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:27,080
Davis gets that one to go just his second field goal. He was one for nine prior to that. It's an eight-point game

441
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,320
Despite the horrific shooting by the lakers, especially their stars again. They're only down eight curry

442
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,880
Another three back to back threes for step curry. Now. He's got 12

443
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,200
And this equals the largest lead of the first half

444
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,000
Wiggins back in now curry switches on james

445
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,800
the two former mvps

446
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,800
Davis against wiggins

447
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,600
Davis settles for the jump shot and rebound to scott. Oh anderson

448
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,440
Green beautiful pass ahead to scott. Oh anderson stripped by caldwell pope

449
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,640
Schruder tries a three

450
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,200
And then schruder still without a field goal. James to davis davis blocked green got a piece of it

451
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,920
And the warriors go the other way

452
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:29,420
Another forced turnover by golden state curry gets inside blocked by struder here comes caruso the other way caruso

453
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,360
Almost tried an alley-oop to himself

454
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,800
Somehow managed to get the layup to go. He did alley-oop until himself got away with it, which is fine

455
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,080
You can throw it up

456
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,200
But I I tell you what green not giving james a dunk

457
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,360
to me as

458
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,360
next level intelligence

459
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:56,360
Graham on green cross court to pool pool for three knocks it down a three-pointer for golden state

460
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:03,240
Now the golden state warriors showing once again why they've been one of the best defensive teams

461
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:09,500
In the nba this season led by dream on green and guys you got to figure and watch so much basketball

462
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,200
He's one of the smartest defensive players i've seen in in all my years covering the nba

463
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:21,740
Well, I had the privilege of coaching him so i'm well aware from day one his instincts his intelligence superior

464
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,640
True to the drive

465
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:31,480
Nearly another forced turnover, but called well pulp has it and a whistle and a foul. Let's check in with rachel

466
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:37,400
Mike, this is so interesting according to all the tracking data. We have now if you look over the past eight years

467
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,400
No one has defended anthony davis on more plays than yep

468
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:47,320
Draymond green so draymond told me that that means there's no surprises ad knows all of his little tricks

469
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:52,200
He knows all of anthony's instead. He said quote what it's going to boil down to in this game

470
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:58,360
It boils down to heart it boils down to who wants it more it boils down to who can out think the guy

471
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,680
Other guy on a particular play

472
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,440
He said it's not that I will go and say I don't know what he's capable of

473
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,120
I know what he's capable of draymond said it's can I stop him?

474
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,840
And as you guys have noted tonight, we've seen a clinic draymond's been doing that work mike

475
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,320
Thank you. Rachel as wiggins picks up the foul james hits the free throw

476
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,720
He just seems to shine come playoff time and he looks for these type of games these type of matchups

477
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,440
But you know what? He knows also coach. He knows that

478
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,880
And it's his advantage when it comes down to heart and it's no disrespect to anthony davis

479
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:37,640
But he he has a fight his chance in that situation if it boils down to talent. It's anthony davis all day long

480
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,200
And he's got a good line up there

481
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,320
He's got a good line up there

482
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,400
Laker's shooting 30 from the field 29 from three

483
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:56,540
And they have 38 points with a minute and a half to play in the second curry three-pointer two strong rebound caruso

484
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,840
Davis comes back to caruso

485
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,840
And caruso

486
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:17,480
Caldwell pulp corner three is up shot. No good and wiggins with a rebound and great block out by tiskano anderson

487
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,960
You don't see blocking out

488
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:27,560
But he eliminated davis's size with that block out wiggins nice turnaround shot wouldn't go james looks to lead the break the other way

489
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:34,280
Pass inside caruso layup tough shot able to get it off the glass caruso is their leading score

490
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,760
And their only player double figures with 12

491
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,600
And that's a good sign if you're the golden state warriors game plan discipline

492
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,800
And I like this lineup with davis at five

493
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,480
A lot more from a spacing standpoint

494
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:58,040
Pool cross card, it's kind of anderson with five to shoot and hits the three-pointer law to scott o anderson eight points off the bench

495
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,400
Back to 12 with 25 seconds remaining

496
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:10,200
The three leading scores for the la lakers james davis intruder three for 27 from the field

497
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,120
Trueter the drive layup is good tough shot. He finally gets one to go. He was 0 for 8

498
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,460
And i'm not allowing steph curry to play one on one in this situation

499
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:28,120
Either are they curry step back three bang at the buzzer

500
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:34,220
Steph curry from downtown and the warriors will take a 13-point lead into halftime

501
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,160
What a first half for golden state

502
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:47,980
Defensively putting on a clinic and then curry coming alive from free point range in the second period

503
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,880
Baze more steps back three-pointer way off rebound loonie, but he's called for a push

504
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,880
looney, by the way had 11 rebounds in that first half as he picks up his second coach if I was

505
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:16,760
Dennis shrewder lebron james anthony davis looking at what we talked about the impact in that first half i'd cut off the coach

506
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,000
The coach's speech in the locker room at halftime and i'd look and say i've got to be better

507
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,200
I've got to do a better job of taking care of my business forget about what's on the board

508
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:32,940
Again considering those numbers they're fortunate to be only down by 13 as we've seen in the nba

509
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,760
13 points is not a huge deficit to overcome

510
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,440
As the shot clocks down to four shrewder drives on wiggins

511
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,640
And a foul

512
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,640
I'll take it on the side

513
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,720
We'll send it over to rachel

514
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:52,840
Well mike i'm told there was plenty of excitement as the warriors piled into the locker room coming off that great

515
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,840
Step shot to close the first half

516
00:42:54,840 --> 00:43:01,020
But i'm also told it only lasted about 15 seconds and then steve kerr got everyone to buckle down and refocus

517
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:06,680
No major adjustments for the warriors, but he did tell the team prepare for the lakers to make some runs here

518
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:12,680
They're a championship team. We just have to weather them meanwhile over on the lakers side the coaching staff told players

519
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:19,720
They got to be more physical against this warrior squad. They do have that size advantage, but they also told the guys just relax

520
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,840
Just relax we're missing wide open shots just

521
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,360
Ease into it here. These are shots that you can make mike

522
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,040
Thank you, rachel this draymond green picked up the foul initially josh tibbens said

523
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,920
It was on the floor but talked with his fellow officials. They changed it to the act of shooting

524
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,720
No, he got bullied by lebron james into asking. No, that's that's the real deal

525
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,520
That's another way of putting it and they changed the call and i'm not saying it wasn't the right call

526
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,160
I'm saying that's why

527
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:56,760
They discussed it and I would have a different message for the lakers. I wouldn't say relax. I would say we're too relaxed

528
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,760
Let's do something

529
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:07,240
No doubt warriors look like the hungry team curry saves it but right to shooter on an erin pass from green

530
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,120
And here comes james

531
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,080
James gets into the paint mid-range jumper shot one goal loonie another rebound quick outlet to curry

532
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,080
Curry to base more attacks the rim layup shot. No good

533
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,020
Golden state looking to push it every opportunity

534
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:33,400
Shruder draws the foul shot won't go but step curry will pick up his second personal

535
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,560
and that's been a problem for golden state all year, which is

536
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,200
fouling too much

537
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,760
And to start this half

538
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:48,440
They haven't made them make shots they put shrewder to the line twice sure missed 14

539
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:56,220
Days down the stretch with the health and safety protocols played the last two games, but his conditioning is far from where it should be

540
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,760
So

541
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:21,960
Shruder led the team in scoring when lebron james was out mark. They need him to be super aggressive

542
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,260
Absolutely out of pick and rolls in transition

543
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,740
At their best he's that third option and at times carries them offensively

544
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,680
Curry to green green try to jam it

545
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:39,640
James and drumming right there james down the other end lamp locked a foul counted and one stolen down

546
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:45,000
And a chance for a three-point play and suddenly it's just a seven-point game with a free throw

547
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,120
The coach a recipe for disaster if you're the warriors

548
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:55,100
Allowing the lakers to get to the free throw line turning the basketball over and giving them easy opportunities in transition

549
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,560
Sometimes teams in this league frustrate me

550
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,520
But what the utah jazz just did by giving out?

551
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,160
52

552
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,160
full ride scholarships

553
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,320
to underserved kids

554
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,960
Is a home run that the whole league

555
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,680
Should adopt absolutely

556
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,280
When the players were calling the kids I looked at that video

557
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,560
And I was absolutely so proud of utah

558
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,400
And the players I just thought it was brilliant

559
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:35,160
So special for those young men and women as wiggins spins and backs at home

560
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,520
Back up to eight for golden state warriors have led the entire game

561
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,320
Lakers have not led the largest lead

562
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,720
Is 13

563
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:47,800
Right now 57 49 called well pulp to james james kicks it out

564
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:54,200
Caldwell pulp off the bounce running lap is good sweet bowl from contagious called well pulp

565
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,640
He's got eight points and I like that offensive set by

566
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,640
Los angeles having james as the screener

567
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:06,440
When he's the screener it is really hard to guard pick and roll curry behind the back flips it up and

568
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:13,100
Went a little short as davis grabs the rebound and especially the screener with curry involved it puts you in the dilemma defensively

569
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,480
James to davis davis three-pointer won't go

570
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:26,540
Lakers just five of 19 from downtown golden state has hit twice as many threes

571
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:31,740
Dangerous pass stolen by called well pope called well pope down the other end layup block but a foul

572
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:39,180
Raymond green upset after the turnover the called wall pulp will shoot a couple of free throws

573
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:45,200
But again, we're talking about a team that's struggling to score you're giving them opportunities

574
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:51,820
Carelessness on the offensive end by the warrens and they're already the lakers are already in the penalty

575
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,980
So they're showing up to the top of the game

576
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:58,460
And the lakers are already in the penalty so they're shooting the rest

577
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:04,860
Of the quarter while la hasn't committed a team foul. No golden state already five team fouls

578
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,820
And called well pope's numbers

579
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,500
One of these teams tonight will earn the seventh seed in the west and the right to

580
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:18,140
Get into the nba playoffs and you can watch the nba playoffs starting saturday on abc

581
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,620
espn tnt

582
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,620
And nba tv the winner tonight

583
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,620
Will face phoenix

584
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:29,900
That game one will be sunday time to be determined in phoenix against the suns

585
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:35,980
Just a spectacular season they finished second utah finished one

586
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,300
These two teams in the playing

587
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,780
shrewder against

588
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:48,540
Wiggins playing physical wig and spins tied up shot clock at five green another turnover

589
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:52,700
As davis brings it into the front court

590
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,540
Back up shrewder puts up the three puts it in

591
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,660
Dennis shrewder just his second field goal

592
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,380
And it's a one-point game

593
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:06,380
You get into rhythm at the free throw line. So he caught a rhythm at the free throw line

594
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,900
And now he knocks in the three

595
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,380
And a foul down the other end

596
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:17,100
Crowd doesn't like it. There's about six thousand fans here at the staples center tonight

597
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,940
And this is just a wide open

598
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:25,900
Catch and shoot three and mike you mentioned six thousand fans. I also love

599
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:32,540
That they have they were able to get more fans because they have what a vaccinated section. Yep. I I love that

600
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:36,780
Curry step back three-pointer and his foul

601
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:42,640
Shruder commits the personal that's going to be his first and curry will shoot three free throws

602
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:49,600
First personal second team and I thought he kicked out his leg. I would really think about challenging that

603
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,280
He does get into that landing area

604
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:08,480
And mike you talked about the winner playing the phoenix sons want to say congratulations to coach mondy williams who the coaches

605
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:14,000
Voted him as the coach of the year. Yep his season in nba a job well done and an award well deserved

606
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:15,920
Absolutely

607
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:21,920
Terrific job and I love their whole team attitude. They weren't trying to to manipulate the standings

608
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,720
Whoever comes our way comes our way

609
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,120
How about the season chris paul has had for that team?

610
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,560
Meanwhile, these two coaches

611
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,640
A little chess match right now

612
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,440
Curry hits all three lead back up to four

613
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
18 points for curry

614
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,480
As a successful coach in this league for so many years

615
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,680
Did you ever try to manipulate the standings and see who he was going to match up with now? I just

616
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,920
I had a like just whether I was right or wrong that whole

617
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,760
Karma

618
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,600
As anthony davis takes another three. I I just didn't believe in it

619
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,080
If you want to if you're if you're a player that's going to be a player that's going to be a player that's going to be

620
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,740
But I think there's some

621
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:04,800
m Landry

622
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,400
changed

623
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,340
is

624
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:10,720
the

625
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,840
Big terminal

626
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,100
I was really stuck with my

627
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,620
My standing and jIT

628
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:20,800
I just didn't believe in it. If you want to if you're if you're a championship mentality,

629
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,800
I just think you got to play everybody

630
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:27,360
Blocked by looney drumm and try to get it to go. He thought he was fouled again

631
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,860
And the left spin.

632
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,600
Wiggins one on one with LeBron James,

633
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,140
who's just two of nine from the field.

634
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,380
Jumper is good.

635
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,380
He's gotta look at it like it's disrespectful.

636
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,880
As good a defender as Wiggins is,

637
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,520
you're gonna play me one on one?

638
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,080
Recognize who I am.

639
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,520
Take it personal.

640
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,060
Shruder gets right up into Curry.

641
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,860
Curry splits the defense.

642
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,700
Curry's first pass stolen by Caldwell Pope.

643
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,060
That's nine turnovers.

644
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,840
Now for the Warriors.

645
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,540
Four of them already here in his third quarter.

646
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,800
We played just five minutes.

647
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,780
Shruder baseline jumper is short.

648
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,380
Curry triple team finds Looney.

649
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,020
Touch pass to Baysmore.

650
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,280
Corner three is good.

651
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,240
Baysmore with his third three pointer.

652
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,080
And now Frank Vogel wants a time out.

653
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,180
The lead right back up to seven.

654
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,060
The 11th three pointer for Golden State.

655
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,120
You know what I'd like too?

656
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,020
The sweatsuits that the Warriors are wearing

657
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,300
with paying homage to Oakland.

658
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,800
That's pretty good.

659
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,640
I love that.

660
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,800
Drummond hands off Caldwell Pope.

661
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,740
Double team him.

662
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,900
And now Shruder across the lane.

663
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,840
Shot clock down to seven.

664
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,140
Shruder given some room.

665
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,240
Hesitated.

666
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,200
Shot clock at two.

667
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,180
Caruso on the drive.

668
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,640
On the pull up shot way off.

669
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,480
And a 24 second violation.

670
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,020
Another excellent defensive sequence from Golden State.

671
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,760
But I thought Shruder cooperated.

672
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,880
He had a couple of shots that he turned down

673
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,720
instead of being aggressive.

674
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,860
And I'll tell you what I find interesting.

675
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,900
Didn't they say before the game

676
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,820
that they wanted to limit LeBron James to 28 or 30 minutes?

677
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,600
He only has eight minutes left.

678
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,660
He's sitting right now.

679
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:31,300
He played 17 and a half minutes in the first half.

680
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,200
And 22 overall so.

681
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,040
Wiggins against Caruso.

682
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,240
Wiggins nice feet inside.

683
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,640
Looney gathers.

684
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,680
And throws up a shot off the glass.

685
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,480
Just his second field goal.

686
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,320
But Looney's played some excellent defense

687
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,680
and he has 12 rebounds.

688
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,880
And they missed him earlier in the possession

689
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,420
by Green on a slip.

690
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,420
Drummond across the lane.

691
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,520
Flips it up and in.

692
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,020
Four points for Drummond.

693
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,740
Curry gets away from the double team.

694
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,460
Continues left handed off the glass.

695
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,300
Won't go.

696
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,560
Chipped in by Kavon Looney.

697
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,380
Looney part of those championship teams.

698
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,040
He's got the corporate knowledge.

699
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,880
Drummond calling for it.

700
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,080
One on one with Looney.

701
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:31,960
Spins in the paint.

702
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,780
Falls down.

703
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,620
Lost it.

704
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,460
And Baysmore fouled by Schroeder.

705
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,720
And if I'm the Warriors,

706
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,500
you're doing me a favor.

707
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,960
Posting up Drummond against Looney.

708
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,900
I know he scored the last possession.

709
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,760
But if I'm Anthony Davis,

710
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,060
I've got to look to be aggressive

711
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,840
and demand the basketball.

712
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,320
This is not a winning recipe, coach.

713
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,240
I agree.

714
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,120
If you can get them to post Drummond,

715
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,520
that plays away from their strength.

716
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,360
But again, I like this.

717
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,300
Inserting the highly intense Wes Matthews

718
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,200
and putting Anthony Davis at the center position.

719
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,640
Matthews' first minutes tonight.

720
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,860
Curry long distance.

721
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:10,700
That's a three.

722
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,640
Steph Curry.

723
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,540
This fourth three pointer of the game.

724
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,100
It's back up to a dozen.

725
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,680
Toscano, Anderson, and Mulder back in now.

726
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,620
Stripped by green and stolen.

727
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,460
Ball loose.

728
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,280
Picked up by Curry.

729
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,180
Knocked out of his hands by Caruso.

730
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,900
Caldwell, Pope to Caruso.

731
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,480
Cross court, Matthews.

732
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,700
Matthews for three.

733
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,600
Talk about an instant contribution.

734
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,840
And that's a huge turn of events.

735
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,560
Up 12, all the momentum going in transition.

736
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,980
Curry turns it over and then a three.

737
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,440
Caruso steal on that.

738
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,660
An important play.

739
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,680
And then a foul called on Caldwell, Pope.

740
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,020
Frank Vogel irate again.

741
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,120
I'm looking at the sideline and you see greatness in Drake

742
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,320
and Michael B. Jordan just shaking their head

743
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,560
at Chef Curry with a shot.

744
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:04,060
And the response, Caruso to Matthews.

745
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:07,180
Knocked down shot, giving the Lakers life.

746
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,320
Matthews in his first year and there they are.

747
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:17,340
And the

748
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,180
court side, Draymond Green blocked by Davis.

749
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,820
Anthony Davis sensational defensive play.

750
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:29,420
And Green usually gets a layup of game off that fake

751
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,780
to Curry.

752
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,780
Davis calling for it, gets it inside.

753
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,020
Shots good and one.

754
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,940
Davis at both ends and a chance for a three point play.

755
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:53,600
B

756
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,640
o

757
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,600
f

758
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,840
g

759
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,160
d

760
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,220
g

761
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:10,340
Davis only 36 games played during the regular season missed 36

762
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,300
30 of them with that right calf

763
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:18,260
He was starting to show signs last final games of the season at that 42-point game against phoenix

764
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:21,460
He has struggled so far tonight, but still a long way to go

765
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:30,100
Six point warriors lead four minutes to play pass inside to curry missed the layup but a foul we got to show that

766
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:35,300
That is brilliance moving without the basketball and not a foul a goal tending

767
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,380
I mean, that's right mark. So two points for curry. It's just so good

768
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:49,780
If more guys were willing to move at the speed and the consistency of curry they'd be rewarded too matthews misses

769
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,780
So

770
00:57:54,580 --> 00:58:01,960
Curry stumbles a bit now keeps his dribble alive against davis lost it ball deflected and a backcourt violation

771
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,500
Well curry's been loose with the ball

772
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,260
This quarter, but this is brilliant comes off the initial screen

773
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,620
Sets it up like he's going to come off the stagger back cuts

774
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,420
that's just

775
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:22,500
Well anthony davis was saying, you know, usually when a guy gives up the ball the defender can relax a little bit

776
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:26,580
He goes but that's when steph curry is his most dangerous after he gives up the ball

777
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:32,660
And I know I said it before but think about it you add clay thompson who moves in a similar form and fashion

778
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:35,240
The pressure that they put on your defense collectively

779
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,020
Is unmatched in the history of this game?

780
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:43,220
Matthews to davis scarred by tiskano anderson green looking to help

781
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:50,260
Davis spins contested shot way off that one at the side of the backboard and green gets the rebound

782
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:59,540
A well-timed double team by green on the baseline side davis now three for 16 to scott o anderson pass the base more

783
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:07,460
A lot of contact over in the far side base more three-pointer won't go davis the rebound

784
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,700
Under three to play here on the third

785
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:17,700
Alex caruso goes all the way blocked by green base more the other way

786
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:24,180
Train on green again just putting on a defensive clinic

787
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:30,420
Plus six assists five rebounds gets inside layup. He missed it

788
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:33,540
Ball knocked out of bounds still golden state ball

789
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,540
Green thought he was fouled

790
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,540
As caruso turned in the corner

791
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,660
Sees green

792
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:50,420
That's outstanding defense and help by draymond green has been doing it all night long. That's his third block

793
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,540
Warriors have eight to shoot jordan pool has come in

794
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,460
Lebron james back in

795
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:07,300
Pass inside to wigens stolen by james. That's the seventh turnover here in the third. They only had five the first half kuzma to davis

796
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:14,340
The fast break can be lethal for the lakers and they've cut the deficit to six and the warriors lose this game

797
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:19,780
They're going to look at this quarter and recognize this is where it happened carelessness on the offensive end

798
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:25,380
Another turnover but warriors are going to be able to get the ball back in the corner

799
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:27,380
And the second half of the season

800
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,020
Another turnover

801
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,060
But warriors get it back wigens for three

802
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:43,860
Under two to play third quarter here in this playing game kuzma backdoor layup is good

803
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,100
Time out golden state

804
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:58,680
The marquee matchup of the plan is not disappointed

805
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:08,020
Curry tied up gets it inside the green green to wigens wigens hard off the glass won't go the tip is up and good

806
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:18,740
Boy wigens playing with a force tonight at both ends. He's got 15. It's a six-point warriors lead

807
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,460
Matthews cuts looking for davis

808
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,660
James three-pointer puts it in

809
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,780
his first three-pointer

810
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:41,140
Of the night and it's a three-point game, but you look at the post up play what wigens had on one-on-one. He shoots a

811
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:43,700
Fade away one leg a shot

812
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,140
Now knocks down a three that's good defense. Sometimes you just got to give credit to greatness

813
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:51,540
Oh curry beautiful pass but wigens couldn't handle it and kuzma comes the other way

814
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,780
Fade away

815
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:58,980
Lob it in davis throws it down wakers within one

816
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:12,820
Boy, is it fun to hear a large crowd the noise of that once again curry on the drive

817
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:21,220
Curry for three that's good. Steph curry from way downtown his fifth three-pointer of the night

818
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:26,100
I mean other great NBA players

819
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:34,820
Can't shoot that he is one of a kind on that type of pass it sprint catch and fire

820
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:40,720
James back to order Caruso another backdoor cut leads to a layup

821
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:47,060
but there's more space on the floor now that the traditional center is out and

822
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:53,700
So there's more cutting avenues no fouls to give here for the Lakers dream on green wide open for three

823
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:03,300
Welcome back to the State Farm NBA play-in tournament here with coach Frank Vogel Frank

824
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:09,220
What do you attribute that lockdown defense in the third quarter? You really forced a bunch of Warriors turnovers?

825
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:14,280
Yeah, that's a pretty good most of the night. We wrapped it up a little bit in that quarter

826
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,560
We know that steps border to get going still hit a few bombs on us

827
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:21,200
You know, we got to live with that but you know, our guys are motivated and you know

828
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:29,960
Do or die fourth quarter a playoff berth on the line you've got Steph Curry on the other side

829
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,960
What do you tell your guys gonna execute?

830
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:36,000
Okay, just that's what you got to worry about get our defensive coverage is and get a good shot every time down

831
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Thank you so much

832
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:45,400
All right, Rachel James the rebound after the beautiful feed to Davis to tie the game opening minute here fourth quarter

833
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,660
Warriors

834
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:50,440
largest lead was 13 early in the third and

835
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:55,920
The Warriors did a good job when curry and green rested in the first half

836
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:02,640
But this is danger zone right now James inside bank shot missed it and come on looney could not quite hold on

837
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,060
And it's Laker ball with 14 now on the shot clock

838
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:13,820
And I love this substitution of draymond green coming back in that's just a beautiful pass to Davis

839
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:17,920
You need to match greens minutes with Davis

840
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:26,340
Kuzma trying to get free and they lob it into Kuzma over pool lays it up and in

841
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,720
You know Lakers with their first lead of the night

842
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:34,820
How long does Steve Kerr leave Steph Curry out at his ballgame

843
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:41,900
That's the ninth assists from LeBron James Mulder to pool

844
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:48,260
Pulls been excellent off the bench down the stretch of the regular season. It's a whole different ballgame

845
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:56,140
Mulder harassed and stolen by Caruso the turnovers continue to mount the second half for the Warriors

846
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:01,240
And this is where Wiggins was stationary that entire possession

847
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:08,520
He's got to be great when curry rest James drives on Toscano Anderson layup banks at home

848
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,680
timeout Golden State

849
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:30,160
Wiggins battling with Matthews Matthews an excellent defender throughout his career

850
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,880
Wiggins trying to draw foul didn't get the whistle

851
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:38,360
We said a lot about the lake the Warriors turning the ball over you got to give credit to this lake of defense

852
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:43,960
They have increased the volume and I think it starts with who you're playing. So West Matthews

853
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,860
He has been intense as James goes in with the reverse

854
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,980
And there's more room on the floor

855
01:05:52,980 --> 01:06:00,260
Now six-point lead that's a 19-point turnaround here on the second half curry looking to Scott O Anderson driving layup

856
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:03,420
offensive foul James draws the charge

857
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:07,180
Davis falls on top of them

858
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:15,580
And I think Steve Kerr may be challenging this and that's a block

859
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:19,300
It is going to be a challenge

860
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:27,220
So they'll challenge those guys will get up and we'll see what happens

861
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:32,560
Eight points five rebounds off the bench

862
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:40,500
It's only the 11th and 12th free throws of the game for Golden State

863
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:44,300
Second half so far

864
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:48,060
They haven't played mantras harrell. They haven't played

865
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:53,180
Porton Tucker, they've gone with a very tight rotation

866
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:00,340
Steve Kerr has only played eight players

867
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:05,700
His team trails by five two and a half gone by in the fourth Caruso the drive

868
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:11,900
Davis the tip won't go to Scott O Anderson a rebound again Draymond Green contesting the shot

869
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,900
Curry back into green

870
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:19,020
Davis on curry

871
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:22,540
Green pass tried to thread the needle and turned it over

872
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:28,660
I had beautiful feet to Matthews good transition defense though from the Warriors

873
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:32,580
Kuzma the drive can't finish

874
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:39,460
Wiggins back to the corner

875
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:41,460
Wiggins

876
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:44,300
Barrels into Matthews offensive foul

877
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:48,860
Boy, what a call from Frank Volga to get West Matthews off the bench

878
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:50,860
He has really had an impact as a coach

879
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:56,760
You have to have guys that you trust that when is when it matters most I know exactly what they're going to do

880
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,120
And West Matthews has been proven to be a competitor at an elite level

881
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:05,820
And a guy that has no quit and he has come out and got it done on a defensive end especially

882
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:08,700
This is why they signed him. It's his first year with the Lakers

883
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:14,380
He's 34 his 12th year in the league. The Lakers are his seventh team. He's always been an excellent defensive player

884
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,700
tough fearless

885
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,700
Rob Palenka

886
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:24,020
Wanted to ring him for these kind of games. There's certain matchups. You need him defensively can also hit a three

887
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:31,920
Competitors only apply it's hard to find great competitors West Matthews is

888
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:37,860
Davis jump shot got it Anthony Davis has come alive in the second half

889
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,000
You know Laker lead is seven

890
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:46,040
Curry for three answers

891
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:48,880
Steph Curry with a six three-pointer

892
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:55,940
He's got 29 when he cleared a whole side eliminate the help and allow Steph Curry to win his matchup one-on-one and Caruso

893
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:57,940
Was substituted out of the game?

894
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:04,880
Curry on Davis isolated there on the elbow Wiggins looking to help pool comes over to help

895
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:11,520
Matthews inside Kuzma shot clock at four Kuzma tough fall away shot in and out

896
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,940
Now the fight for the rebound goes to Draymond Green

897
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:22,400
Curry on the drive scoop layup he banks at home all what a sweet move from curry

898
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,580
31 points and it's a two-point game

899
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:27,580
And

900
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,780
Pool just pushing Matthews out of the way

901
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:39,580
That's going to be the first team foul here on the fourth no Caruso

902
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:44,180
Arassing him through to insert it into the game Steph Curry knocks down the three gets a rhythm

903
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:46,820
Then keeps them off balance turns the corner

904
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:54,940
Spectacular finish before the contest an efficient game for curry 10 of 18 from the field six of nine from three

905
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:58,620
Davis left alone for three got it

906
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:05,420
Anthony Davis his first three-pointer of the night he was all for five and it's back to a five-point Laker leave

907
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:10,460
Get a couple of layups get a dunk and now the jump shot becomes a little bit

908
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:15,480
Easier he struggled from three-point range all season long

909
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,300
Just 26%

910
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:22,840
well good find by James as

911
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,360
Green tries to take away the role

912
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,640
Always chatting away who's straight on green

913
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:39,960
Curry gets free drives inside scoop layup missed it. He thought he was hit see her is furious

914
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,060
Here's James the other way long three-pointer

915
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,320
Caroms out to Mulder

916
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:52,520
Jordan poor all beautiful crossover tried to jam it ball knocks loose out of bounds

917
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,040
And it's gonna be Warriors ball

918
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,520
That would have been quite the highlight for Jordan pool

919
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:05,280
I'm giving him a point just for the move and he got found

920
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
How was that not a foul

921
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:20,400
Why are you looking at me? I'm not reffing Wiggins pull on the inbound and it's back to three

922
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,840
I

923
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:32,420
True to brings it up with 643 remaining the Bron James sitting right now

924
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,680
Well, he's at his minute limit

925
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:46,440
I wonder if we'll see him again entry pass knocked away by Draymond Green pull ahead to Wiggins Wiggins drives floats it up shot is good

926
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:50,980
19 points for Wiggins and it's back to one timeout LA

927
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,980
Marv Albert the greatest basketball announcer of all time

928
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:01,040
Whose impact on aspiring broadcasters is immeasurable?

929
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:05,800
Congratulations. Thanks for a spectacular career Marv Albert

930
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:10,440
And I'm one of those guys three years with Marv Albert as a partner

931
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,120
congratulations legend

932
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:17,020
Paul misses screen dives Kuzma no comes up with it

933
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:23,380
Just past the midway point of the fourth Schroeder draws the foul shot won't go

934
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:31,580
I'm just trying to imagine you as a head coach of the Lakers right now

935
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:36,220
What the looks you would be given LeBron James like basically asking while you are you ready yet?

936
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:38,860
No, I wouldn't be giving him dirty looks I'd be given that

937
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:42,540
Whoever's in charge of the minutes police. I'd be like

938
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,660
Come on now. We'll give him off tomorrow

939
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:52,420
And the next day as Caruso is gonna come back in to the game

940
01:12:53,940 --> 01:13:00,080
Schroeder has struggled tonight just two of eleven from the field, but it's the free-throw Lakers back up to

941
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:07,900
Caruso will come in and Matthews sits 11 minutes for Matthews, but he made his presence felt I

942
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:15,020
Think the key obviously was the Lakers activity, but I think Frank Vogel found for this game

943
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:19,620
Davis at five playing huge minutes already up to 36 and

944
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:22,620
Going to West Matthews

945
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:25,020
Was a huge factor in

946
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:27,660
their swarming defense

947
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:30,660
Schroeder goes one for two

948
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:34,660
Caruso back in the guard curry

949
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:40,380
Finds Wiggins Wiggins gets inside draws the contact and banks at home chance for a three-point play

950
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,500
Big plays from Wiggins on both ends of the floor tonight

951
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:50,740
An unselfishness of Steph Curry takes the double-team gets rid of the basketball

952
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:55,660
Wiggins aggressive turns the corner and if you're anybody on a lake is not defending curry

953
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:59,380
You have to pull all the way over so he doesn't have ability to catch and finish

954
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:02,860
Wiggins wants to get the victory get back in the playoffs

955
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:06,300
He's only been in the playoffs once in his first six years in the league

956
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:09,980
That was five games in the first round with Minnesota in 2018

957
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:16,900
He has had a terrific season. He's played 71 of the 72 games in the regular season and here in the plan

958
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:23,180
21 points on 10 of 18 from the field. He's available every game every year

959
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:27,260
He plays all the time as Durham is the first team to play in the playoffs

960
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:30,820
All the time as durable as any player in this league

961
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:36,960
Kuzma back out to Schroeder shot clock at three puts up the three shot won't go one of the foul

962
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:40,060
Davis the offensive rebound back up and banks at home

963
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,460
But there's an awful lot of contact

964
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:50,220
Not just on the shot, but also Davis's rebound and finish Anthony Davis discarded people curry reverse

965
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:56,180
With the English off the glass a little more magic from Steph Curry. He's got 33

966
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,740
And LeBron James is coming back in

967
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:05,260
Schroeder drives inside Caruso missed a layup curry the rebound

968
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:09,700
Curry to Wiggins

969
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:14,000
Jordan Paul, nope, they wave it off an offensive foul

970
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:20,100
Sound a screen set by Draymond Green not allowing the chase down contest

971
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:25,540
James will return

972
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:28,540
Three fouls on green

973
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:41,500
Credit to Anthony Davis for not giving up on the play. So his effort to try to get to the shooter forced that call

974
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:48,020
That's 12 second half turnovers for Golden State. They only had five in the first half

975
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:50,740
They led by 13 at halftime

976
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,740
Lakers have

977
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:57,860
Taken the lead here in the fourth. They've led by as many as seven right now all tied with four and a half to play

978
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:08,020
This is a tough play to guard the curl by Davis Davis knocked away another steal from Draymond Green and

979
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:10,620
Mulder in the front court

980
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:16,880
Three steals three blocks for green curry on the drive gets inside foul on jumper. No good

981
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:22,560
11 rebounds for Davis to go with 21 points

982
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,640
Mulder up and into Schroeder

983
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:35,380
Drives layup shot is good. Oh, what a tough shot from Schroeder and Draymond Green wanted a push-off

984
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,940
Green's got to be careful with the referees. He already has a technical tonight

985
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Gets the pass from curry

986
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,240
pull for three puts it in

987
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:56,960
Warriors back up by one and that's where green is great you blitz curry

988
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,240
And

989
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:03,000
You get it to green and he plays four on three

990
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:08,720
He's a great great decision maker and it may boil down to just that

991
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:16,600
Other guys not named curry making shots being ready and aggressive because the Lakers are forcing curry to get rid of the basketball

992
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:23,360
Dennis Schroeder tries drives on Wiggins flips it up shot. No good rebound rebound Draymond Green

993
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,960
And here come the Warriors up one

994
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,680
with 315 remaining

995
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,840
Curry fakes curry drives floats it up banks at home

996
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,400
Timeout Lakers

997
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:43,000
Here's the upcoming national TV schedule TNT tomorrow, Indiana and Washington

998
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:48,160
At Eastern for the right to get into the playoffs then the ESPN on Friday

999
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:53,400
Memphis winning earlier tonight against San Antonio will play the loser of this game

1000
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:59,520
And it'll be at 9 Eastern for more in these games visit nba.com or the NBA app

1001
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,460
This has been a thriller here at the Staples Center

1002
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:08,100
Anthony Davis and the Lakers came back from 13 down took a seven-point lead here on the fourth

1003
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:14,300
But Steph Curry erupting here with a fourth. He's got 35 for the game and it's the Warriors up three and

1004
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:18,580
interestingly Frank Vogel decides to sit Schroeder and

1005
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,700
reinsert Wesley Matthews I

1006
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,820
Think it's the right move

1007
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:28,900
Absolutely, they got to make an adjustment because the Warriors clearing a side for curry

1008
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:36,060
They have to recognize that defensively the Lakers do and be in position to help James looking to post up Baysmoor

1009
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:40,900
Squares and faces seven on the shot clock

1010
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:46,540
Wiggins looking to help James for on the 24 James jumper short

1011
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:53,740
Rebound Matthews back out to James pass to Caruso corner three side of the backboard and Baysmoor gets the rebound

1012
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:58,900
That talked about it earlier Wiggins forcing LeBron into that shot

1013
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:03,920
That's a shot you're willing to give up if you're the Warriors defensively against a bigger stronger

1014
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:09,280
And Caruso's defense forces the turnovers curry dribbles it out of bounds and

1015
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,920
So inside the Davis the runner

1016
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:18,520
No good, but a foul that's absolutely inexcusable on a turnover. They didn't get matched up

1017
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:23,600
So green had to rotate to the wide open Caruso and now Davis gets fouled

1018
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:29,920
So Paul picks up his third and Anthony Davis will shoot free throws

1019
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:36,200
Two for two tonight, it's only 74% during the season

1020
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,920
Big

1021
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,920
Second half for Davis

1022
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,600
Only had five points at halftime

1023
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:12,040
18 in the second half one point game under two and a half remaining

1024
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:21,440
Curry on the drive the floater in the paint short Wiggins tips it but right to Davis

1025
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:24,780
James running the floor

1026
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,600
Pass to Caruso back to James and he's fouled

1027
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:34,100
Draymond Green would not let him get a layup and James goes down holding his head

1028
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,520
The officials discussing

1029
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:47,100
I think they're going to take a look at it to see if it's a flagrant

1030
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:49,100
And

1031
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:51,780
There's contact to the head of LeBron James

1032
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:55,660
It'd be interesting to see the conclusion that they come up with here

1033
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:58,900
But there's clearly with the right hand of Draymond Green to the head

1034
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:11,020
Goes up the block. This is a huge call again because it will be free throws and possession as green picks up his fourth personal

1035
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:16,780
But clearly to me there was contact on the head according to the rules but not everything to the head is a flagrant foul

1036
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:19,260
You need to make up your mind sir. No, I

1037
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:27,660
Don't think it is one. I think it will be called one and I hate when games are decided on these like

1038
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,500
Influenced by like these like they're trying to

1039
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:34,540
Make a difference in the game

1040
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:41,620
And just can we play ball this is a great game absolutely you have covered every base by the way my friend well done

1041
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:48,220
Well James obviously shaken up by the play so he's gonna get two free throws

1042
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:52,220
And he's really get two free throws and will they get possession and he's smart enough to

1043
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:55,020
Make sure they know he's hurt

1044
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:58,300
Oh

1045
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:05,820
I'm gonna name my next son John Gobel. Thank you John bring some sanity back to the NBA

1046
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:11,660
You know and again part of it. It's just such a crucial call for I

1047
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:17,900
Mean he's looking he's going up to block the shot hands down. I think what Steve said there's no wind-up

1048
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:24,380
And he's going up to block the shot hands down. I think what Steve said there's no wind-up

1049
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:31,900
And the impact is because James comes into him and I'm not gonna take I'm not gonna explain myself to the whole LA roster

1050
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:36,460
Play ball. Well James will get the two free throws

1051
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:43,420
I'm not good at Ripley lip reading, but I think he just said something about trouble scene

1052
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:51,500
Though again as Steve Javi said it was a good game

1053
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:58,060
Though again as Steve Javi said it was an awkward fall and that made it look worse than it was and apparently got poked in

1054
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:59,660
the eye to

1055
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:06,700
My only problem with it. It wasn't a contest to the basketball. It was a contest to the face because he can't jump as well

1056
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:15,580
Ties the game with 207 remaining

1057
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:20,700
I've been there before squinting my eyes just in case I miss a free throw so I have an excuse

1058
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:23,660
I've been there

1059
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:31,260
At a rough first half but has made huge plays here in the second half a triple double

1060
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:34,620
misses the second

1061
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:41,100
And a loose ball foul is going to go against lebron james. Jordan pool did a good job pursuing that rebound

1062
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:46,220
And really you look right now both teams are shooting the rest of the way

1063
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:50,700
So you if you're going to be physical defensively you have to be physical and disciplined also

1064
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:52,860
But you don't give up free clothes

1065
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:57,100
Each team with one timeout left and as mark said both teams in the penalty

1066
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:02,380
Baysmoor to pool

1067
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:04,460
wigons green and curry

1068
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:10,160
And an offensive foul call on draymond green on the moving screen west matthews draws that turnover

1069
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:16,460
Steve kerr can't believe that call nor can green who picks up his fifth

1070
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:19,340
And

1071
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:28,460
That's not a legal screen to me that's west matthews selling the foul he's had an important impact on this second half

1072
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:33,420
Caldwell pope back up to james

1073
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:37,500
Wiggins has done an excellent job defensively on him tonight

1074
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:44,300
Shot clock at six james looking to get a running start now pass to caruso caruso on the drive inside davis for the slam

1075
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:52,780
Lakers back up two with a minute and a half to play and caruso has been outstanding outstanding great find

1076
01:24:54,620 --> 01:25:00,460
Curry the drive looking to draw contact and he does but they say before the shot doesn't matter. They're in the penalty

1077
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:05,580
So two free throws for curry to tie the game with 123 left

1078
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:10,700
Well, they go back to putting step curry into the pick and roll knowing they don't want to switch it

1079
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:13,900
James came off touched it to caruso who just

1080
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:17,580
Caught it on a stampede to the basket and dropped it off

1081
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:20,620
to davis well anthony davis who had

1082
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:23,180
an awful first half

1083
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:25,740
Has come alive 25 points including

1084
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:34,060
13 here in the fourth quarter as curry hits the free throw and played 41 minutes so far

1085
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:38,940
12 rebounds as well and it's made some excellent defensive plays in the second half

1086
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:42,140
This game has been so much about defense from both teams

1087
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:51,840
Curry ties the game 37 points for step curry

1088
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:08,220
They get it to call well pulp almost lost it shot clock at seven

1089
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:15,180
James two defenders on him to call well pope inside. He's tied up by green throws it back up top. James puts up the three

1090
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:18,960
Oh, it's gone lebron james from downtown

1091
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:21,740
As the shot clock expires

1092
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:28,140
A desperation heave and the lakers are up three

1093
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:30,140
Three

1094
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:39,580
Green back to curry curry sets leans in knocked away get it back from curry shot clock at seven

1095
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:45,740
Baysmore on the drive kicks it out pull for three

1096
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:49,420
James the rebound with 32 seconds remaining

1097
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:54,560
There's about a 10 second different shot clock and game clock. They don't have to foul

1098
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:01,180
I'm lebron james. I'm putting my head down and attacking

1099
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:06,460
Lost the ball gets it back matthews for three

1100
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:13,180
Fight for the rebound tipped twice picked up by pole 10 seconds remaining i'm in a foul

1101
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:17,260
I'm, not letting them shoot a three. They have a timeout left, but we'll call it here

1102
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:22,940
Cur is trying to call it and finally he gets it steve kirk came to half court

1103
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:25,900
The officials couldn't see him or clearly couldn't hear him

1104
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:29,820
And he gets the timeout with 2.1 remaining

1105
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:34,220
We'll see if the officials look to see to perhaps put more time on the clock

1106
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:42,800
They got a great look the last time by jordan pool in the corner off a nice pass by baysmoor

1107
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:51,760
LeBron james with the three-pointer had to throw it up. The shot clock was expiring

1108
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
So

1109
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,200
Big time shot

1110
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,520
awful execution

1111
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,720
Realizes that the clock dwindling down the good chase down by curry

1112
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:05,040
lebron

1113
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:10,000
Elevates and knocks down the biggest shot of the night. That's a 30-footer and you see curry

1114
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:19,200
Who's had that look on opponent's faces after he knocks down threes the same look as lebron james with a clutch shot

1115
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:24,720
And still talking about his

1116
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,960
Difficulty seeing after taking that shot in the face from draymond green

1117
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
All right, guys, obviously

1118
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:36,000
Golden state needs a three-pointer here to try and force overtime

1119
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:43,120
And for the lakers there's not enough time for them to foul and not allow a three-pointer, correct? It depends on where the ball is caught

1120
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,160
And in what position?

1121
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,720
I wouldn't be surprised if curry

1122
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:52,240
Is used to try to free somebody else up

1123
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:56,640
Because of team's natural reaction to him

1124
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:03,620
No matter what type of cut he makes and that guy defending the basketball in lebron james in this scenario

1125
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I keep my eyes on curry

1126
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,120
Baysmoor to inbound

1127
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:13,120
Pool coming free curry trying to get free lost the ball. That's it

1128
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:16,080
The lakers are in the playoffs

1129
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:21,700
The warriors need to play on friday what a thriller here at the staples center

1130
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:38,880
I want to show these two stars put on tonight lebron james with his vision

1131
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,880
And

1132
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:48,480
Bothered after that shot from draymond green hits the desperation heave that proved to be the game winner

1133
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:52,480
offsetting the 37 points from steph curry

1134
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:57,200
Lakers will play phoenix on sunday

1135
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:05,700
The warriors will play the grizzlies on friday night to keep their season alive and the respect from the two former mvps

1136
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,880
Is

1137
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,520
Warriors with an opportunity but

1138
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:19,760
A defensive play ends this one and that's perhaps appropriate with all the terrific defense we saw tonight

1139
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,960
This is he didn't even catch it in rhythm

1140
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:33,680
That's just unbelievable just as the shot clock expired and he was blind

1141
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,480
So

1142
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:40,800
James with 22 points 11 rebounds 10 assists

1143
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,600
And the game winning three-pointer

1144
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,920
Is with rachel?

1145
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,260
lebron

1146
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:49,260
Congratulations on the win

1147
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:52,080
Nice little celebration there with anthony davis

1148
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,760
Yes, sir, you already know

1149
01:30:56,320 --> 01:31:02,000
What does this mean to you guys to be officially in the play-in bracket in the playoff bracket and to do it with this kind?

1150
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:07,520
Of win tonight over a team that has really been such a huge rival for you over the second half of your career

1151
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:10,800
Well, I mean going into the postseason. I think it's two of the hottest teams

1152
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:14,400
I think we were winner of five they were winner of uh, seven or eight or whatever the case may be

1153
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:19,760
So both teams playing at a high level and uh, we knew that they're going to come up to our floor and give everything they had

1154
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:24,000
Um, you know, they hit us in the mouth in the first half and we just had to respond and we did that

1155
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:30,080
On the defensive end and uh got some great contributions from guys off the bench. Um, and we all you know chipped in for the

1156
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:36,720
We got to talk about that shot you hit with about a minute left the three you didn't even look in rhythm there

1157
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:38,720
What were you thinking as the ball left your hands?

1158
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,280
um, you know just um

1159
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:45,440
I put in a lot of work in my game, you know, um, you know after

1160
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,400
You know drape my uh finger to the eye. I was literally seeing three, uh, three rims out there

1161
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:54,960
um, so I just shot at the middle one and uh, and I was able to uh,

1162
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,520
The grace of the man above I was able to knock it down

1163
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,720
When in doubt go for the middle rim

1164
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:04,880
What did it feel like when you were down there on the floor when you took that hard fall?

1165
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:08,000
Were you worried that you wouldn't be able to continue in the game or have more problems?

1166
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,880
You know, i've been there before

1167
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:14,960
Um, you know, i've been poked in the eye before, you know on a rim collision like that. So

1168
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:19,120
Just try to keep my composure, you know, it's going to be pretty sore tonight. I know that for sure

1169
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,000
But we have a few days until we do until we know

1170
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:24,560
when we'll go to phoenix, but

1171
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:27,760
It's a big time win for us and I definitely wasn't leaving the floor no matter if I had to

1172
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:31,280
Uh, you know, uh put a pirate, uh patch in my eyes. So

1173
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:34,160
I love this team. I love to compete

1174
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:37,360
One big rivalry down with this win tonight

1175
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:43,040
But you've got another one to go with an old friend in chris paul you mentioned going to phoenix and facing the suns

1176
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:45,120
What do you think that matchup is going to be like?

1177
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:49,440
um, you know, they played, uh, extremely well all year and they deserve to uh,

1178
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
You know host, uh, you know

1179
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,000
home court in the first round

1180
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,800
And uh cp, uh, you know played at an mvp

1181
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:04,400
Uh caliber year all year, um book, you know, aden has grown all year and uh, they've given those guys a supporting cast around them

1182
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:09,440
So, you know, uh, we know what we're going to get out of cp. We know how good uh, you know

1183
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:14,800
How great cp is how great book is uh up and coming surgeons from um, you know from aden

1184
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:19,440
You know, but it's the other guys as well that we got to make sure we key in on because they've been playing extremely

1185
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:23,120
Well all year and that's why they've been the second best team in the west. Thank you so much. LeBron

1186
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,660
Congratulations. We'll see you in phoenix
