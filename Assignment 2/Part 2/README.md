So for Part 2 to get the data to use in Postgres, I used the build-in module in patchcore model. I simply added this line in my excisting code from part 1. I have added the code and a snap shot of the lines I added to the code.

I also uploaded the python script for my postgres portion and the respective results. I used the data that was extracted from the Patchore memory bank. The folder with the Patchore Data is only portion of it since the folder is pretty big. I can always upload the whole thing if needed.
