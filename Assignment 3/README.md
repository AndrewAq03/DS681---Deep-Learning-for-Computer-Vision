# Assignment 3 
Hello, this is my submission for Assignment 3 which involved using the Car Damage Detection dataset which 
contained image of damaged cars and the respective segementaiton masks. With this dataset we were tasked 
with training a the foundation model DINOv3 segmenation head. After doing so we were asked to implement
the Deep SORT algorithm a video to track dents on a vehicle using the DINOv3 model previosuly trained. 

## Folders:

### 1. Dataset
  * This folder contains the Car Damage Detection images and a picture showing the images on the FiftyOne framework

### 2. DINOv3 Training
  * This folder contains the Code for training the DinoV3 model segmenation head
  * There are also some visual images of the results of that training which include the original image, mask segmentation and them overlayed
  * I will link a google drive folder of the PyTorch File(.pth) which contains the models weights and bias

### 3. DeepSORT
  * This folder contains the Code for the creating the detecting and generating bounding boxes on dents from a video I took of a car
  * Also uploaded screenshots of the results of the video generated of the detected dents
  * I will link a google drive folder of the input video used and the output video of the dents generated by DeepSort
