# Hello this is my submission for the Midterm

## Training Files Folder:
  1. The notebook that contains the script doing camera calibration on the training images that was given here https://huggingface.co/datasets/pantelism/wide-camera-calibration
  2. An image of the output at 3000 epochs with the Distortion Coefficients, calibrated Camera Matrix and RMS Error
  3. A similiar image but at 10000 epochs when I was doing some hyperparameter tuning

## Checkerboard Calibartion Folder:
  1. This contains the notebook that was used on the checkerboard images that I took, including the script used to convert
     the images to .parquet dataframe file
  2. An image of the results that show the Distortion Coefficients, calibrated Camera Matrix and RMS Error

## Checkerboard Images Folder:   
  1. Has a few of the images I took of the checkerboard
  2. The .parquert dataframe file used to parse through the images I took

## I have also attached a PDF document giving a brief outline of my script and results
